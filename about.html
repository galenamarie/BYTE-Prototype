   A small cluster of data can add up to a very complete picture of who we are and what we do. 
   <br>
   As younger generations are born into an increasingly online/digital world, 
   <br>
   the general population is becoming more and more comfortable with allowing their data to be 
   <br> 
   collected for the sake of convinience and entertainment. 
   <br>
   BYTE seeks to bring awareness to how our personal data can be collected to provide a 
   <br> 
   startlingly complete image of our population. As the user engages in a very simple
   <br> 
   4-step process, they traverse the gap between individuality and anonymity amongst 
   <br>
   hundreds of other data peices. Spectators do not have to participate, though anyone can
   <br> 
   become part of the peice if they willingly give permission - just as we freely (and perhaps unknowingly) 
   <br> give permission for information about us to be collected every day.
